- [Lung Structures Enhancement in Chest Radiographs via CT based FCNN Training](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1810.05989.pdf)
  - Transfer knowledge from CT to X-Ray images
  - Strong point (?) : X-Ray images are reconstructed / simulated. No paired data required.
  - If we can get access to many CT data, we may further exploit "hidden features" in X-Ray images?
    - We already have plenty of public X-Ray images.
- [Neural Architecture Search: A Survey](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1808.05377.pdf)
  - A survey on neural architecture search
  - very short?
