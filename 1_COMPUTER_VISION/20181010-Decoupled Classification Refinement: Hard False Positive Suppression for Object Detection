Overview
- Shared features may not be optimal for all detection tasks
- Identify Hard false positives and create auxiliary classifiers for them.
- Multi-task settings, make it faster by feature sharing in V2

Thoughts
- It is important to identify hard postive / negatives. Is extra network branches necessary?
  - How about hard negative mining or Focal Loss?
