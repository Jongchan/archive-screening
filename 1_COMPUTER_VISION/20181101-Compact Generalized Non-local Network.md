[Compact Generalized Non-local Network](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1810.13125.pdf)

Overview
- Compact and generalized version of non-local blocks
- Compact by approximating generalized non-local block
- Generalized as it includes interactions among channels in different locations.

Thoughts
- No direct comparison in terms of FLOPS or parameters
- Some metrics show Top-5 of non-local blocks better.
- Overall top-1 performance of CGNL better.
